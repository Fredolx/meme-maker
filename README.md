## Installation
[Both Windows and Linux builds are available here](https://github.com/Fredolx/meme-maker/releases/latest).


The Windows build is batteries-included (has all dependencies pre-packaged), the linux build only depends on ImageMagick7.
A scoop version for Windows is coming soon! You can follow the progress [here](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Extras/pull/12773)

## Usage
meme-maker prides itself in its simplicity. You can generate a quick meme using only two arguments:
```
usage: meme-maker [path to file] [your meme caption]
meme-maker myimage.png "my caption"
```
More customizations can be achieved through optional flags which can be discovered through:
```
meme-maker -h
```
